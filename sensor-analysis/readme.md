Note: needs access to the Hopscotch system. No particular experimental parameters since the data is recorded in a flat file format while including the flow information such as counts of packets from a given IP address to a particular port with the same arrival hop count (i.e., TTL field from the IP packet header), the victim IP address, the timestamp, the service port, and the number of packets.
